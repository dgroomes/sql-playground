# postgres-administration

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Exploring how to administrate Postgres via its many tools like `pg_ctl`.
  
### Overview

I'm curious to learn the basics about how to administrate Postgres. For example, how to start the server, stop it,
restart it, how to reset all the data, where the database files go on the file system. In the past, I've relied on
spinning up Postgres via a Docker container and "starting from scratch" each time. But, I'd like to know how to
administrate Postgres so that I have the option of using Postgres directly instead of via Docker (hello, [Apple Silicon](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4733)).
